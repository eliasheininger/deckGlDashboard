        We are coordinating the global effort to create a validated dataset of
        the energy-related inputs to enable accurate energy system modeling of
        every country in the world. Recently, PyPSA-Earth has been expanded to
        include sector coupling, enabling integrated modeling of different
        economic sectors, including electricity, hydrogen, heating, transport,
        industry, and agriculture. A dedicated modeling stream is focused on the
        detailed representation of microgrids and distribution infrastructure.
